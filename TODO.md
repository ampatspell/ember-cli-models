# TODO

* loader `loadMore`
* expose load state (name?) for pagination
* loader `isLoadable`
* unified loader, filter, sort for relationships
* autoload isLoading notifies state property change. if state is rendered before autoload.isLoading, rendering blows up with 'modified twice in single render'.

* what was compact about?
* optional destroy for models instantiated in route's `model` hook (`isNew`)
* ember-cli-documents adapter as a separate addon
